			<description>High-throughput sequencing technologies allow the production of largevolumes of short sequences, which can be aligned to the genome to create aset of matches to the genome. By looking for regions of the genome which towhich there are high densities of matches, we can infer a segmentation ofthe genome into regions of biological significance. The methods in this packageallow the simultaneous segmentation of data from multiple samples, takinginto account replicate data, in order to create a consensus segmentation.This has obvious applications in a number of classes of sequencing experiments,particularly in the discovery of small RNA loci and novel mRNA transcriptomediscovery.</description>
