			<description>This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set Analysis for GeneExpression (QuSAGE) method described in (Yaari G. et al, Nucl Acids Res, 2013).This is a novel Gene Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed to providea faster, more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene expressionstudies. qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations using the Variance InflationFactor technique proposed by Wu et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition,rather than simply evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with asingle number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a completeprobability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P values and confidenceintervals can be easily extracted. Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hocanalysis (e.g., pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintainingstatistical traceability. Finally, while qusage is compatible with individualgene statistics from existing methods (e.g., LIMMA), a Welch-based methodis implemented that is shown to improve specificity.
