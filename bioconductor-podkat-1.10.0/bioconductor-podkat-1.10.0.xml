			<description>This package provides an association test that is capable of dealingwith very rare and even private variants. This is accomplished by a kernel-basedapproach that takes the positions of the variants into account. The test canbe used for pre-processed matrix data, but also directly for variant datastored in VCF files. Association testing can be performed whole-genome, whole-exome,or restricted to pre-defined regions of interest. The test is complementedby tools for analyzing and visualizing the results.</description>
